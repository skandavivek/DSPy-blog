A tutorial on DSPy and whether automated prompt engineering lives up to the hype

The premise of DSPy is fascinating -what if we could train prompts in the same way we train model parameters? This idea has shown promise in academic settings - led by Stanford research. In another paper, researchers from VMWare showed that automated prompt optimization (powered by DSPy) emerged as the winner over human tuned prompts. 
Following this, IEEE released a perspective titled Prompt Engineering Is Dead. They make the bold claim:
According to one research team, no human should manually optimize prompts ever again.
So let's dive into DSPy using a characteristic few-shot prompting example and see how it does!
